<h2>üßê Key Features</h2>

* **Mighty Image Classification:** WildCats employs the most advanced machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost to conquer the challenge of identifying these majestic creatures accurately. From their elegant spots to fearsome roars, WildCats can distinguish every unique feature!

* **Expert Data Preprocessing:** WildCats streamlines the process by skillfully preprocessing images, converting them into machine-readable feature vectors, and applying one-hot encoding for categorical labels. Preparing your data for the wild adventure has never been easier.

* **Precision through Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune your model's performance with Grid Search and Randomized Search techniques. Optimize the hyperparameters of SVM and Logistic Regression models to achieve superior image classification accuracy.

* **The Strength of Ensemble Learning:** Embrace the power of ensemble learning with WildCats' dynamic Voting Classifier. By combining multiple models, you'll experience an elevated level of classification accuracy. Whether you choose hard voting or soft voting, the choice is yours!  

* **Performance Comparison:** Easily compare the performance of different machine learning models with insightful metrics and visualizations. Witness the strengths and weaknesses of each model, helping you make informed decisions.  

* **Model Interpretability:** Unravel the inner workings of your models with feature importances and coefficient analysis for logistic regression. Understand the factors driving the model's decisions.
